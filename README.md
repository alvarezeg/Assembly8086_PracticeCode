# Assembly8086_PracticeCode

In this repository, I will make random assembly code in order
perfect my skills with the closest language to "Machine Code"

Goals:

      1. Get better at assembly code
      2. Make projects out of assembly code
      3. Use Assembly code for embedded systems.
      
The reason in wanting to learn Assembly is the fact that it's 
difficult to master, and I enjoy learning a skill that people
believe no one can accomplish.


Books That I will Be Reading:

      1. Assembly Language x86 6th Edition by "KIP, R. Irvine"
      2. The Art Of 64-Bit Assembly Vol 1 by "Randall Hyde"
